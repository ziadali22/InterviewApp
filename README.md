# ðŸ“± InterviewApp â€“ Clean Architecture SwiftUI Demo

InterviewApp is a demo iOS project built using **SwiftUI** and structured with **Clean Architecture** principles, designed to demonstrate how to build scalable and testable applications in iOS using a clear separation of concerns.

---

## ðŸ§  Architecture

This app follows the Clean Architecture approach by separating responsibilities into three distinct layers:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic and use cases (pure Swift).
- **Data Layer**: Handles data persistence and repository implementations.
- **Presentation Layer**: SwiftUI views and ViewModels, which consume domain use cases.
